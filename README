Timekeeper by Mikko Jakonen

This is a school project I did for a QT5 course at my university. It's a very simple
time manager application, but I like the UI and it has some nifty QT code in it I
think. I'm putting this up here because I may want to reference it later, and it might
contain useful code for someone, who knows.
